# CNN Practicals: From Scratch and Transfer Learning

## Overview
This repository contains two academic practical implementations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. 
The aim of this project is to provide hands-on understanding of deep learning concepts through structured and well-documented practical work.

## Practicals Included

### Practical 1: CNN From Scratch
- Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network using basic deep learning layers
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Model training and evaluation
- Understanding feature extraction using convolution and pooling layers

### Practical 2: Transfer Learning
- Implementation of transfer learning using a pre-trained CNN model
- Reuse of learned features for efficient training
- Fine-tuning and evaluation on a target dataset
- Comparison with training a model from scratch

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Purpose
This repository is intended for:
- Academic lab practical submissions
- Understanding CNN fundamentals
- Learning transfer learning concepts
- Reference for deep learning coursework

## How to Run
1. Install the required dependencies using `requirements.txt`
2. Open the notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
3. Run the cells sequentially
